Finance-Loan-Private

This module calculates the repayments and tax schedule for a private loan under UK law.

At the time of writing, Interest payments on a private loan (not from
a bank or building society) must be have tax deducted from them by the
borrower. The borrower is responsible for paying this tax to HMRC.

If the loan is for business purposes the borrower can then reclaim the
whole amount of interest paid (net amount paid to the lender plus the
tax paid) as a business expense.

The premium that is calculated by this module is not exact. It may over-
or under-pay slightly and a manual adjustment will be necessary in the
last few months. A configuration file enables you to set the tax rate,
interest rate, period of loan and the amount. The tax rate and the amount
lent may be subject to change during the period of the loan. Monthly
interest is calculated as 1/12 of the  nominal annual rate; this is
not mathematically acccurate, but it is the usual convention in the
financial world.
